# BirdPhotoURLs
Collecting bird photo URLs from WikiMedia for an educational game

We'd like to add more birds, but looking up images is a lot of work. 
YOU CAN HELP!

1. Pick a bird from the list below (birds marked -- are MOST NEEDED)

2. Google the name of the bird and site:wikimedia.org
   - For example...
   - american crow site:wikimedia.org

3. Find a GOOD IMAGE of the bird.
   - Not blurry
   - You can see the full body of the bird (not just the head)
   - Landscape or square image (not portrait orientation)

4. Copy/paste the URL for a good image below the bird name (OR add it to trivia.json). 
   The URL should begin with https://upload.wikimedia.org ...etc.
